            I am a 21 year old student and software developer. I currently 
            reside in East Lansing, MI, with three cats and a puppy. I attend 
            Michigan Stae University and am finishing up two undergraduate degrees in
            Computer Science Engineering and Psychology. I am also a graduate
            student in CSE. Additionally, I am completing minors in Cognitive Science and Philosophy! 
            I am passionate about the environment, LGBTQ+, human rights, BLM, and 
            animal rights.

            Currently, I am finishing up an interdisciplinary thesis on climate change and cognitive
            dissonance, utilizing natural language processing techniques from computer science. 
            In addition, I work on the NASA PeTaL team as an open-source contributer, and am a current intern
            at the Interoperability Institute.
