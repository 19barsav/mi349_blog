                Hello, World!
            </p>
            <p>
                As this is my first blog post on a technical blog site, I had to go with
                the classic ‚Äúhello, world!‚Äù comment. I remember doing my first ‚Äúhello,
                world!‚Äù in Java, roughly 5 years ago. I scoured the internet for other
                examples from other languages and quickly became overwhelmed. Some
                languages are easy (Python) and others need quite a bit of mark-up first
                (Java). I kept pushing forward, though!
            </p>
            <p>
                Must I say, it was a good thing I did. I have never found another field so
                incredibly versatile, flexible, challenging, interesting, and as fun as
                computer science. (Plus, you get the handy ‚Äúengineer‚Äù notation!) Of course,
                this field doesn't come without its problems. It is still incredibly
                separated by gender, and pushes to include female computer scientists only
                focus on lower-paying information technology positions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even still, the field is rapidly expanding through cybersecurity,
                blockchain, artificial intelligence, gaming, etc. The supply of male
                engineers will not last, and female/other-identifying persons will
                eventually come into the spotlight. It may be a shit-show, or it may be
                what we need. Until then, we will continue making safe and welcoming
                workforces, advancing DEI training, and sharing opportunities with one
                another.
            </p>
