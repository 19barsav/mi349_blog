            <h3>Is Your DEI Training Lacking?</h3>

                Good day, readers!
            </p>
            <p>
                I started a new position in February. It is at a Michigan based healthcare
                non-profit, and I have enjoyed every second of working for them.
                Unsurprisingly, I was required to complete training upon my hiring. The
                training was okay, but the DEI training was really lacking in quite a few
                areas. In some instances, the guidance was more dangerous than it was
                useful. Below is how I recognized it, and what I did to bring change. I
                hope it inspires others to speak up in their workplace!
            </p>
            
            <h4>Recognizing It:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Are the steps confusing?</li>
                <li>Do the steps contradict what you've been told before?</li>
                <li>Can you think of a situation where this step would be dangerous</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                In my case, one of the steps was to approach a transgender coworker and ask
                them if you could ask them questions privately. First, asking to ask them
                questions privately is not private, and doesn't seem work appropriate.
                Second, many people of minority groups will say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to remain compliant
                and reflect conflict. Approaching them seems to contradict what folks want,
                and that's to be left alone. Third, asking someone to speak privately puts
                them in an uncomfortable and dangerous situation where they have no
                witnesses if something doesn't go wrong. It is nice to believe that
                everyone has good intentions, but they don't.
            </p>
            
            <h4>How To Fix It:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Recognize that it isn't your job (unless it is!)</li>
                <li>Tell your immediate boss/mentor (optional)</li>
                <li>Speak to someone from the DEI office/ human resources</li>
                <li>Follow-up in a few months to make sure THEY did THEIR job!</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                Hope this helps!
            </p>

            <h3>Welcome to my Blog!</h3>
            <address class="author">By <a rel="author" href="/author/about">Savvy B.</a></address> 
            <time  datetime="2022-05-31" title="May 31st, 2022">05/31/2022</time>
            <p><img src="earth.png" width=100 alt="a clip-art photo of earth with a blushing face on it"></p>
            
            <p>
                Hello, World!
            </p>
            <p>
                As this is my first blog post on a technical blog site, I had to go with
                the classic ‚Äúhello, world!‚Äù comment. I remember doing my first ‚Äúhello,
                world!‚Äù in Java, roughly 5 years ago. I scoured the internet for other
                examples from other languages and quickly became overwhelmed. Some
                languages are easy (Python) and others need quite a bit of mark-up first
                (Java). I kept pushing forward, though!
            </p>
            <p>
                Must I say it was a good thing I did? I have never found another field so
                incredibly versatile, flexible, challenging, interesting, and as fun as
                computer science. (Plus, you get the handy ‚Äúengineer‚Äù notation!) Of course,
                this field doesn't come without its problems. It is still incredibly
                separated by gender and pushes to include female computer scientists only
                focus on lower-paying information technology positions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even still, the field is rapidly expanding through cybersecurity,
                blockchain, artificial intelligence, gaming, etc. The supply of male
                engineers will not last, and female/other-identifying persons will
                eventually come into the spotlight. It may be a shit-show, or it may be
                what we need. Until then, we will continue making safe and welcoming
                workforces, advancing DEI training, and sharing opportunities with one
                another.
